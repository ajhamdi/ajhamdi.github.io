This has motivated much recent work on adversarial attacks for DNNs, which mostly focus on pixel-level perturbations void of semantic meaning. In contrast, we present a general framework for adversarial attacks on trained agents, which covers semantic perturbations to the environment of the agent performing the task as well as pixel-level attacks. To do this, we re-frame the adversarial attack problem as learning a distribution of parameters that always fools the agent. In the semantic case, our proposed adversary (denoted as BBGAN) is trained to sample parameters that describe the environment with which the black-box agent interacts, such that the agent performs its dedicated task poorly in this environment. We apply BBGAN on three different tasks, primarily targeting aspects of autonomous navigation: object detection, self-driving, and autonomous UAV racing. On these tasks, BBGAN can generate failure cases that consistently fool a trained agent.","tags":["sada","robustness","adverserial attacks"],"title":"SADA: Semantic Adversarial Diagnostic Attacks for Autonomous Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Abdullah Hamdi**","Sara Rojas","Ali Thabet","Bernard Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572555600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572555600,"objectID":"53704510c5552ae0254e176b29e412b1","permalink":"https://abdullahamdi.com/publication/advpc-arxive/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/advpc-arxive/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which imperceptible perturbations to their input lead to erroneous network predictions. This phenomenon has been extensively studied in the image domain, and only recently extended to 3D point clouds. In this work, we present novel data-driven adversarial attacks against 3D point cloud networks. We aim to address the following problems in current 3D point cloud adversarial attacks: they do not transfer well between different networks, and they are easy to defend against simple statistical methods. To this extent, we develop new point cloud attacks (we dub AdvPC) that exploit input data distributions. These attacks lead to perturbations that are resilient against current defenses while remaining highly transferable compared to state-of-the-art attacks. We test our attacks using four popular point cloud networks: PointNet, PointNet++ (MSG and SSG), and DGCNN. Our proposed attack enables an increase in the transferability of up to 20 points for some networks. It also increases the ability to break defenses of up to 23 points on ModelNet40 data.","tags":["3D point cloud","robustness","adversarial attacks"],"title":"AdvPC: Transferable Adversarial Perturbations on 3D Point Clouds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Abdullah Hamdi**","Bernard Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568494800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568494800,"objectID":"5bb5828d436cc917b231f6ec23d10f15","permalink":"https://abdullahamdi.com/publication/sr-iccv19/","publishdate":"2019-09-15T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sr-iccv19/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the impressive performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on various vision tasks, they still exhibit erroneous high sensitivity toward semantic primitives (e.g. object pose). We propose a theoretically grounded analysis for DNNs robustness in the semantic space. We qualitatively analyze different DNNs semantic robustness by visualizing the DNN global behavior as semantic maps and observe interesting behavior of some DNNs. Since generating these semantic maps does not scale well with the dimensionality of the semantic space, we develop a bottom-up approach to detect robust regions of DNNs. To achieve this, We formalize the problem of finding robust semantic regions of the network as optimization of integral bounds and develop expressions for update directions of the region bounds. We use our developed formulations to quantitatively evaluate the semantic robustness of different famous network architectures. We show through extensive experimentation that several networks, though trained on the same dataset and while enjoying comparable accuracy, they do not necessarily perform similarly in semantic robustness. For example, InceptionV3 is more accurate despite being less semantically robust than ResNet50. We hope that this tool will serve as the first milestone towards understanding the semantic robustness of DNNs.","tags":["semantic robustness","robustness","adverserial attacks"],"title":"Towards Analyzing Semantic Robustness of Deep Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Abdullah Hamdi**","Bernard Ghanem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555275600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555275600,"objectID":"daae23a478bedeb9fda9f8efbc5a55d2","permalink":"https://abdullahamdi.com/publication/ian-arxive/","publishdate":"2019-04-15T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ian-arxive/","section":"publication","summary":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained momentum for their ability to model image distributions.
